# Manifesto for Agile Software Development (Maindset)

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more. [More here](https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/manifesto.html)

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto, crafted by seventeen visionary software developers in 2001, revolutionized the world of software development.
It introduced a set of guiding principles that emphasize:

- flexibility
- collaboration
- customer satisfaction

These principles advocate for :

- adaptive planning
- evolutionary development
- early delivery
- continuous improvement

All while encouraging rapid and flexible responses to change.
By prioritizing individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan, the Agile Manifesto has become a cornerstone for modern project management and software development practices.
