# Scrum Guide Summarized (and conceptualized)

A **Scrum Team** is a group of individuals working together to deliver the products and solutions in an [Agile](AgileMenifesto.md) environment using the [Scrum framework](DocFiles/Scrum-Framework-with-sdo-logo-9.29.23.pdf).

The **Scrum Team** is typically composed of three key roles (later explained):

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team (=cross-functional)

## Purpose of the Scrum Guide

We developed Scrum in the **early 1990s**. We wrote the first version of the Scrum Guide **in 2010** to help
people worldwide understand Scrum.
We have evolved the Guide since then through small, functional updates. Together, we stand behind it.
Changing the core design or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or **not** following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless.
We use the word “developers” in Scrum **not** to exclude, but to simplify. If you get value from Scrum, consider yourself included.
As Scrum is used, patterns, processes, and insights that align with the Scrum framework described in this document may be discovered, applied, and developed.

---

## Scrum Definition

Scrum is a **lightweight** framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through
adaptive solutions for complex problems.

Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:

1. A **Product Owner** orders (and prioritizes) the work for a complex problem into a **Product Backlog**.
2. The **Scrum Team** turns a selection of the work into an **Increment** of value **during a Sprint**.
3. The **Scrum Team and its stakeholders** inspect (reviews) the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. And **repeating** this cycle continuously.

**Scrum is simple**. Try it as is to see if its philosophy, theory, and structure help achieve goals and create value. The [**Scrum framework**](docfiles/Scrum-Framework-with-sdo-logo-9.29.23.pdf) is purposefully incomplete, defining **only** the necessary parts to implement Scrum theory.
Scrum is built upon by the **collective intelligence of the people using** it.
Rather, than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and
interactions.
Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the Scrum framework.
Scrum **wraps around existing** practices or renders them unnecessary.
Scrum **makes visible** the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made. This **visibility** allows for continuous improvements.

---

## Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on **empiricism** and **lean thinking**.

- **Empiricism** asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed.
- **Lean thinking** reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

Scrum employs an **iterative, incremental approach** to optimize predictability and to control risk.
Scrum **engages groups of people** who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or
acquire such skills as needed.
Scrum combines [four formal events](#four-formal-key-events) for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, [**the Sprint**](#the-sprint).
These events work because they implement the three *empirical Scrum pillars* of **transparency, inspection, and adaptation**.

Here's a breakdown of **The three pillars of Scrum**:

- **Transparency**: Making sure that everyone involved in the process can see all its aspects clearly.
- **Inspection**: Consistently monitoring progress towards a goal to identify any deviations (=action of departing from an established accepted standard).
- **Adaptation**: Making changes promptly to reduce any further deviation from the goal.

By adhering to these principles, Scrum teams can **continuously improve** and deliver valuable products incrementally.\
When the artifacts **lack transparency**, it can result in decisions that reduce value and heighten risk.\

---

## Transparency

The emergent process and work **must be visible** to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work.
With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal [**Artifacts**](#scrum-artifacts).
**Artifacts** that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.
Transparency **enables** inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

---

## Inspection

The [**Scrum artifacts**](#scrum-artifacts) and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently (regularly) and diligently (**thoroughly**) **to detect** potentially undesirable variances or problems.
To facilitate inspection, Scrum provides cadence through its **five events**.

- [The Sprint](#the-sprint)
- [Sprint Planning](#sprint-planning)
- [Daily Scrum](#daily-scrum)
- [Sprint Review](#sprint-review)
- [Sprint Retrospective](#sprint-retrospective)

Inspection **enables** adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered **pointless**.\
Scrum events are designed to **provoke** change.

---

## Adaptation

If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable,
the process being applied or the materials being produced **must be adjusted**.
The adjustment **must be made as soon as possible** to minimize further deviation.
**Adaptation** becomes more **difficult** when the people involved **are not empowered or self-managing**.
A **Scrum Team** is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.

---

## Scrum Values

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:

- **Commitment**: The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other.
- **Focus**: The primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals.
- **Openness**: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open (clear) about the work and the challenges.
- **Respect**: The Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work.
- **Courage**: The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.

The Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the Scrum events and artifacts.
When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.

---

## Scrum Team

The core unit of **Scrum is a small team** known as the Scrum Team. This team includes **one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers**. There are *NO  sub-teams or hierarchies* within a Scrum Team.\
Scrum Team is a unified group (cohesive unit) of **professionals** focused on **one objective at a time**, the Product Goal.

Scrum Teams are **cross-functional**, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value
each Sprint.
They are also **self-managing**, deciding internally who does what, when, and how.

The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. Smaller teams communicate more effectively and are more productive. If Scrum Teams grow too large, they should consider splitting into **multiple cohesive** Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. These teams should **share** the same Product **Goal**, Product **Backlog**, and Product **Owner**.

The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related tasks, including stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and any other necessary activities that might be required.
They are structured and **empowered by the organization** to manage their own work. Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency

The entire Scrum Team (the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master are) is accountable (are responsible) for delivering a valuable and useful Increment at the end of each Sprint.

---

## Developers

Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
The Developers are always accountable for:

- **Creating a plan** for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog.
- Instilling (ensuring) quality by adhering (according) to a Definition of Done.
- Adjusting (adapting) their plan daily to achieve the Sprint Goal.
- Holding each other accountable as professionals.

---

## Product Owner

The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.
How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

The Product Owner is also responsible for effective **Product Backlog management**, which involves:

- Developing and explicitly communicating the **Product Goal**.
- Creating and clearly communicating **Product Backlog** items.
- Ordering (and prioritizing) Product **Backlog items**.
- Ensuring the Product Backlog is **transparent, visible, and understood**.

The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner **remains** accountable.

For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review.

The Product Owner is **one person**, not a committee and is responsible for the Product Backlog.

---

## The Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for establishing Scrum as outlined in the Scrum Guide, by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.
Additionally, the Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum Team improves its practices within the Scrum framework.

Scrum Masters are true leaders who **serve** the Scrum Team and the larger organization.

*The Scrum Master* serves (supports) the **Scrum Team** in various ways, including:

- **Coaching** the team members in self-management and cross-functionality
- **Helping** the Scrum **Team** focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done
- **Causing** the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress
- Ensuring that all **Scrum events** take place and are positive, productive, and kept **within the timebox**.

*The Scrum Master* servers the **Product Owner** in various ways, including:

- **Helping** find techniques for effective Product **Goal** definition and Product **Backlog management**
- **Helping** the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product **Backlog items**
- **Helping** establish empirical product planning for a complex environment
- Facilitating **stakeholder** collaboration as requested or needed.

*The Scrum Master* serves the **organization** by:

- **Leading**, training, and coaching in Scrum adoption.
- **Planning and advising** on Scrum implementations.
- **Helping** employees and stakeholders adopt an empirical approach for complex work.
- Removing barriers between stakeholders and **Scrum Teams**.

## Scrum Events

The Sprint is a **container** for all other events. Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to **inspect** and **adapt** Scrum artifacts.\
These events are specifically designed to enable the **transparency** required.\
**Failure to operate any events** as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt.\
**Events** are used in Scrum to create **regularity** and **to minimize** the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.\
**Optimally**, all events are held at the **same time and place** to reduce complexity.

---

## The Sprint

Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where **ideas are turned into value**.

They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency.\
A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

**All the work** necessary **to achieve** the;

- Product Goal, and
- including;
  - Sprint Planning,
  - Daily Scrums,
  - Sprint Review, and
  - Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

During the Sprint:

- **No changes** are made that would **endanger (risks)** the Sprint Goal;
- **Quality** does not decrease;
- The **Product Backlog** is refined as needed; and,
- **Scope** may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Product Goal at least every calendar month.\
When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase.\
Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame.\
Each Sprint may be considered a short project.

Various practices exist to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows.\
While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism.\
In complex environments, what will happen is unknown.\
Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.

A Sprint could be cancelled if the **Sprint Goal** becomes **obsolete**.\
Only the **Product Owner** has the **authority** to cancel the Sprint.

## Four formal key events

In Scrum, a popular [Agile framework](docfiles/Agile-Framework.png) for managing complex projects, there are **four formal key events** that occur within each Sprint (**a time-boxed period** usually 2-4 weeks, during which a specific set of work is completed).

Here's a breakdown of **four formal Sprint events**:

1. **[Sprint Planning](#sprint-planning)**: This event kicks off the Sprint. The team collaborates to define what can be delivered in the upcoming Sprint and how that work will be achieved. This ensures transparency about the team's goals and plans.

2. **[Daily Scrum](#daily-scrum)**: A short, daily meeting (usually 15 minutes) where team members inspect their progress towards the Sprint Goal and adapt their plan for the next 24 hours. This promotes transparency and allows for quick adjustments.

3. **[Sprint Review](#sprint-review)**: Held at the end of the Sprint, this event involves the team presenting the work completed during the Sprint to stakeholders. Feedback is gathered, which helps in inspecting the outcome and adapting future work.

4. **[Sprint Retrospective](#sprint-retrospective)**: This is the final event of the Sprint, where the team reflects on the past Sprint to identify improvements. They discuss what went well, what didn't, and how processes can be adapted to improve future Sprints.

These events are all contained within the Sprint, which acts as a container event.

---

## Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning **initiates** the Sprint by laying out the **work to be performed** for the Sprint.\
This **resulting plan** is created by the **collaborative** work of the **entire Scrum Team**.\
The **Product Owner** ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss **the most important Product Backlog items** and how they map to the Product Goal.\
The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.

**Topic 1: Why is this Sprint valuable?**

The **Product Owner** proposes how the product could increase its **value and usability** in the current Sprint.\
The entire Scrum Team then collaborates to define a **Sprint Goal** that communicates why the Sprint is **valuable** to stakeholders.\
The Sprint Goal must be **finalized** prior to the end of Sprint Planning.

**Topic 2: What can be Done this Sprint?**

Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint.\
The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which increases understanding and confidence.\
Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be challenging.\
However, the more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.

**Topic 3: How will the chosen work get done?**

For **each selected Product Backlog item**, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an **Increment** that meets the Definition of Done.\
This is often done by **decomposing** Product Backlog items **into smaller work items of one day or less**.\
How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers.\
No one else tells Developers how to turn **Product Backlog items into Increments** of value.\
The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.\
**Sprint Planning** is timeboxed to a maximum of **eight(8)** hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

---

## Daily Scrum

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is **to inspect progress toward** the Sprint Goal and **adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary**, adjusting the upcoming planned work.\
The **Daily Scrum is** a 15-minute event **for the Developers** of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.
If the **Product Owner** or **Scrum Master** are actively working on items in the **Sprint Backlog**, they **participate** as Developers.

The **Developers** can select whatever **structure and techniques they want**, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. **This creates focus and improves self-management**.\
Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.\
The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan.
They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s work.

---

## Sprint Review

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to **inspect the outcome** of the Sprint and **determine future adaptations**.\
The **Scrum Team** presents the results of their work **to key stakeholders** and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review **what was accomplished in the Sprint** and **what has changed in their environment**. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities.
**The Sprint Review is a working session** and the **Scrum Team should avoid limiting** it to a presentation.
The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four(4) hours for a one-month Sprint.

---

## Sprint Retrospective

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is **to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness**.

The **Scrum Team** inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to;

- individuals,
- interactions,
- processes,
- tools, and
- their Definition of Done.

**Inspected element**s often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray (deviate) are identified and their origins explored.

The **Scrum Team** discusses;

- what went well during the Sprint,
- what problems it encountered, and
- how those problems were (or were not) solved.

The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness.\
The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible.\
They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.\
The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint.\
It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one month Sprint.

---

## Scrum Artifacts

In Scrum, key decisions rely on the perceived condition of its **three formal artifacts**, artifacts are;

- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Incrementals (=deliveries according to Definition of Done)

Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value.
They **are designed to maximize transparency of key information**. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.
**Each artifact contains a commitment** to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:

- For the **Product Backlog** it is the Product Goal.
- For the **Sprint Backlog** it is the Sprint Goal.
- For the **Increment** it is the Definition of Done.

These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum Values for the Scrum Team and their Stakeholders.

---

## Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is an emergent, **ordered (and prioritized) list** of what is needed to improve the product.
It is the **single source** of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint **are deemed ready** for selection in a Sprint Planning event.
They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities.
Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items.
This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size.
Attributes often vary with the domain of work. The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing.
The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.

## Commitment: Product Goal

The Product Goal outlines a **future state of the product**, guiding the Scrum Team's planning.\
The Product Goal is in the **Product Backlog**, which evolves to detail what will achieve the Product Goal.\
The Product Goal is the **long-term objective** for the Scrum Team.\
The Scrum Team must complete one Product Goal before moving to the next.\
A product delivers value, has clear boundaries, stakeholders, and defined users.\
A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.

## Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Goal is in the Sprint Backlog, selected Product Backlog items, and a plan for delivering the Increment.\
It is a real-time, detailed plan by the Developers, updated throughout the Sprint to track progress and achieve the Sprint Goal.

## Commitment: Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is the **main objective** for the Sprint, providing flexibility in the work needed to achieve it and fostering team coherence and focus.\
Created during Sprint **Planning** and added to the Sprint **Backlog**, it guides the Developers, who collaborate with the Product Owner to adjust the scope if needed without changing the Sprint Goal.

## Increment

An Increment is a **verified, usable step** toward the Product Goal, additive to prior Increments. Multiple Increments can be created within a Sprint and presented at the Sprint Review (demo), but they can also be delivered to stakeholders earlier if they meet the **Definition of Done**.

## Commitment: Definition of Done

The Definition of Done is a formal description of the Increment's quality standards, ensuring transparency and shared understanding.
If a Product Backlog item meets this Definition of Done, it becomes an **Increment**; otherwise, it returns to the backlog.
All Scrum Teams must adhere to the Definition of Done, whether it's an organizational standard or created by the team.

## End Note

Scrum is freely available in this Guide, is immutable and must be implemented in its entirety to be considered Scrum.\
It serves as a framework that can incorporate other techniques, methodologies, and practices.

## People

Jeff Sutherland, Jeff McKenna, John Scumniotales, Ken Schwaber, Mike Smith, and Chris Martin were key contributors to the early development of Scrum. Many others have since refined Scrum, making it what it is today.

## Scrum Guide History

Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland first presented Scrum at the **1995 OOPSLA Conference**, formalizing their previous learnings. The Scrum Guide, developed by them over 30 years, documents Scrum, while other sources offer complementary insights to enhance its effectiveness.
