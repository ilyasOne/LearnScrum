# Scrum Guide Summarized

First things first. A **Scrum Team** is a group of individuals working together to deliver the products and solutions in an [Agile](AgileMenifesto.md) environment using the Scrum framework. The team is typically composed of three key roles (later explained): Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team (=is cross-functional).

## Scrum Definition

Scrum is a **lightweight framework** that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through
adaptive solutions for complex problems.

Scrum involves a Scrum Master creating an environment where:

- the **Product Owner** prioritizes tasks in a Product Backlog
- the **Scrum Team** completes selected tasks in a Sprint (=**a time-boxed period** usually 2-4 weeks)
- Both the **team and stakeholders** review and adjust for the next Sprint
- And **repeating** this cycle continuously.

Scrum is **simple** and should be tried as is to see if it helps achieve goals and create value.
The framework is **purposefully incomplete**, defining only the necessary parts to implement Scrum theory.
It is built upon the **collective intelligence** of its users.
The rules guide **relationships and interactions** rather than providing detailed instructions.

- Various **processes, techniques, and methods** can be used within the Scrum framework.
- Scrum **integrates** with existing practices or makes them unnecessary.
- It **highlights the effectiveness** of current management, environment, and work techniques.
- This **visibility** allows for continuous improvements.

## Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on **empiricism** and **lean thinking**.

- **Empiricism** asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed.
- **Lean thinking** reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

Scrum uses an **iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk**.
It **engages groups** with all necessary skills and expertise to complete the work.
Team members **share or acquire** skills as needed.
Scrum combines **four formal events** for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint.

In Scrum, a popular Agile framework for managing complex projects, there are **four formal key events** that occur within each Sprint (**a time-boxed period** usually 2-4 weeks, during which a specific set of work is completed).

Here's a breakdown of **four formal events**:

1. **Sprint Planning**: This event kicks off the Sprint. The team collaborates to define what can be delivered in the upcoming Sprint and how that work will be achieved. This ensures transparency about the team's goals and plans.

2. **Daily Scrum**: A short, daily meeting (usually 15 minutes) where team members inspect their progress towards the Sprint Goal and adapt their plan for the next 24 hours. This promotes transparency and allows for quick adjustments.

3. **Sprint Review**: Held at the end of the Sprint, this event involves the team presenting the work completed during the Sprint to stakeholders. Feedback is gathered, which helps in inspecting the outcome and adapting future work.

4. **Sprint Retrospective**: This is the final event of the Sprint, where the team reflects on the past Sprint to identify improvements. They discuss what went well, what didn't, and how processes can be adapted to improve future Sprints.

These events are all contained within the Sprint, which acts as a container event. They work effectively because they embody the three pillars of Scrum:

Here's a breakdown of **The three pillars of Scrum**:

- **Transparency**: Making sure that everyone involved in the process can see all its aspects clearly.
- **Inspection**: Consistently monitoring progress towards a goal to identify any deviations (=action of departing from an established accepted standard).
- **Adaptation**: Making changes promptly to reduce any further deviation from the goal.

By adhering to these principles, Scrum teams can continuously improve and deliver valuable products incrementally.

In Scrum, key decisions rely on the perceived condition of its **three formal artifacts**, artifacts are;

- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Incrementals (=deliveries according to Definition of Done)

When these artifacts **lack transparency**, it can result in decisions that reduce value and heighten risk.
**Inspection** enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.
**Adaptation** becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing.

## Scrum Values

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:

- **Commitment**: The Scrum Team is dedicated (commits) to reaching its goals and helping one another.
- **Focus**: Their main focus is on the Sprint work to achieve the best possible progress toward these goals.
- **Openness**: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are clear about the work and the challenges they face.
- **Respect**: Scrum Team members respect each other as capable, independent individuals and are respected in the same way by their colleagues.
- **Courage**: Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing and tackle difficult problems.

## Scrum Team

The core unit of **Scrum is a small team** known as the Scrum Team. This team **includes one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers**. There are *NO  sub-teams or hierarchies within a Scrum Team*. It is a unified group of **professionals** dedicated to a **single objective at a time**: the Product Goal.
**Scrum Teams are cross-functional**, with members possessing all the skills needed to create value each Sprint. **They are also self-managing**, deciding internally who does what, when, and how.

Smaller teams communicate more effectively and are more productive. If Scrum Teams grow too large, they should consider splitting into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. These teams should **share** the same Product **Goal**, Product **Backlog**, and Product **Owner**.

The Scrum Team handles all product-related tasks, including stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and any other necessary activities.

The whole Scrum Team (the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master) is responsible for delivering a valuable and useful Increment at the end of each Sprint.

## Developers

Developers in the Scrum Team are dedicated to creating any part of a usable Increment during each Sprint.
The Developers are always accountable for:

- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog
- Ensuring quality by following the Definition of Done
- Adjusting their plan daily to achieve the Sprint Goal.
- Holding each other accountable as professionals.

## Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product generated by the Scrum Team's efforts.

The Product Owner is also responsible for effective Product Backlog management, which involves:

- Developing and clearly communicating the **Product Goal**.
- Creating and clearly communicating **Product Backlog** items.
- Ordering Product **Backlog items**.
- Ensuring the Product Backlog is **transparent, visible, and understood**.

The Product Owner's decisions should be evident in the content and prioritization of the Product Backlog, as well as in the inspectable Increment presented at the Sprint Review.

The Product Owner is **one person**, not a committee and is responsible for the Product Backlog.

## The Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for establishing Scrum as outlined in the Scrum Guide by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization. Additionally, the Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum Team improves its practices within the Scrum framework.

*The Scrum Master* supports the **Scrum Team** in various ways, including:

- **Coaching** team members in self-management and cross-functionality.
- **Helping** the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done.
- **Removing impediments** to the Scrum Teamâ€™s progress.
- Ensuring all **Scrum events are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox**.

*The Scrum Master* supports the **Product Owner** in various ways, including:

- **Assisting** in defining effective Product Goals and managing the Product Backlog.
- **Helping** the Scrum Team recognize the importance of clear and concise Product Backlog items.
- **Establishing** empirical product planning for complex environments.
- **Facilitating** stakeholder collaboration as needed or requested.

The Scrum Master supports the **organization** by:

- **Leading**, training, and coaching in Scrum adoption.
- **Planning and advising** on Scrum implementations.
- **Helping** employees and stakeholders adopt an empirical approach for complex work.
- **Removing barriers** between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

## Scrum Events

The Sprint includes all other Scrum events, providing formal opportunities to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are designed to ensure the necessary transparency. When events do not proceed as planned, opportunities for inspection and adjustment are missed. Scrum events create regularity and minimize the need for additional meetings. Ideally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.

## The Sprint

Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where **ideas are turned into value**.

All the work necessary to achieve **the Product Goal**, including **Sprint Planning**, **Daily Scrums**, **Sprint Review**, and **Sprint Retrospective**, happen within Sprints.

During the Sprint:

- **No changes are made that risks the Sprint Goal**.
- **Quality** stays consistent.
- The Product Backlog is **refined as necessary**.
- ***Scope* can be clarified and renegotiated** with the Product Owner as new information emerges.

Sprints ensure predictability by allowing for regular **inspection and adaptation** towards the Product Goal, at least once a month.
If a Sprint is **too long**, the Sprint Goal may become **invalid, complexity may increase, and risks may rise**.
Shorter Sprints can generate more learning cycles and limit the risk of cost and effort to a smaller timeframe, treating each Sprint as a short project.

Various practices like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows can forecast progress, but they do not replace the importance of empiricism.
**In complex environments, only past events can inform future decisions.**

A Sprint can be **canceled** if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, and only the **Product Owner has the authority to cancel it**.
