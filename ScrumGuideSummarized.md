# Scrum Guide Summarized

First things first. A **Scrum Team** is a group of individuals working together to deliver the products and solutions in an [Agile](AgileMenifesto.md) environment using the [Scrum framework](DocFiles/Scrum-Framework-with-sdo-logo-9.29.23.pdf). The team is typically composed of three key roles (later explained): Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team (=is cross-functional).

## Scrum Definition

Scrum is a **lightweight framework** that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through
adaptive solutions for complex problems.

Scrum involves a Scrum Master creating an environment where:

- the **Product Owner** prioritizes tasks in a Product Backlog
- the **Scrum Team** completes selected tasks in a Sprint (=**a time-boxed period** usually 2-4 weeks)
- Both the **team and stakeholders** review and adjust for the next Sprint
- And **repeating** this cycle continuously.

Scrum is **simple** and should be tried as is to see if it helps achieve goals and create value.
The framework is **purposefully incomplete**, defining only the necessary parts to implement Scrum theory.
It is built upon the **collective intelligence** of its users.
The rules guide **relationships and interactions** rather than providing detailed instructions.

- Various **processes, techniques, and methods** can be used within the Scrum framework.
- Scrum **integrates** with existing practices or makes them unnecessary.
- It **highlights the effectiveness** of current management, environment, and work techniques.
- This **visibility** allows for continuous improvements.

## Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on **empiricism** and **lean thinking**.

- **Empiricism** asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed.
- **Lean thinking** reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

Scrum uses an **iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk**.
It **engages groups** with all necessary skills and expertise to complete the work.
Team members **share or acquire** skills as needed.
Scrum combines **four formal events** for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint.

In Scrum, a popular Agile framework for managing complex projects, there are **four formal key events** that occur within each Sprint (**a time-boxed period** usually 2-4 weeks, during which a specific set of work is completed).

Here's a breakdown of **four formal events**:

1. **[Sprint Planning](#sprint-planning)**: This event kicks off the Sprint. The team collaborates to define what can be delivered in the upcoming Sprint and how that work will be achieved. This ensures transparency about the team's goals and plans.

2. **[Daily Scrum](#daily-scrum)**: A short, daily meeting (usually 15 minutes) where team members inspect their progress towards the Sprint Goal and adapt their plan for the next 24 hours. This promotes transparency and allows for quick adjustments.

3. **[Sprint Review](#sprint-review)**: Held at the end of the Sprint, this event involves the team presenting the work completed during the Sprint to stakeholders. Feedback is gathered, which helps in inspecting the outcome and adapting future work.

4. **[Sprint Retrospective](#sprint-retrospective)**: This is the final event of the Sprint, where the team reflects on the past Sprint to identify improvements. They discuss what went well, what didn't, and how processes can be adapted to improve future Sprints.

These events are all contained within the Sprint, which acts as a container event. They work effectively because they embody the three pillars of Scrum:

Here's a breakdown of **The three pillars of Scrum**:

- **Transparency**: Making sure that everyone involved in the process can see all its aspects clearly.
- **Inspection**: Consistently monitoring progress towards a goal to identify any deviations (=action of departing from an established accepted standard).
- **Adaptation**: Making changes promptly to reduce any further deviation from the goal.

By adhering to these principles, Scrum teams can continuously improve and deliver valuable products incrementally.

In Scrum, key decisions rely on the perceived condition of its **three formal artifacts**, artifacts are;

- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Incrementals (=deliveries according to Definition of Done)

When these artifacts **lack transparency**, it can result in decisions that reduce value and heighten risk.
**Inspection** enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.
**Adaptation** becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing.

## Scrum Values

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:

- **Commitment**: The Scrum Team is dedicated (commits) to reaching its goals and helping one another.
- **Focus**: Their main focus is on the Sprint work to achieve the best possible progress toward these goals.
- **Openness**: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are clear about the work and the challenges they face.
- **Respect**: Scrum Team members respect each other as capable, independent individuals and are respected in the same way by their colleagues.
- **Courage**: Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing and tackle difficult problems.

## Scrum Team

The core unit of **Scrum is a small team** known as the Scrum Team. This team **includes one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers**. There are *NO  sub-teams or hierarchies within a Scrum Team*. It is a unified group of **professionals** dedicated to a **single objective at a time**: the Product Goal.
**Scrum Teams are cross-functional**, with members possessing all the skills needed to create value each Sprint. **They are also self-managing**, deciding internally who does what, when, and how.

Smaller teams communicate more effectively and are more productive. If Scrum Teams grow too large, they should consider splitting into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. These teams should **share** the same Product **Goal**, Product **Backlog**, and Product **Owner**.

The Scrum Team handles all product-related tasks, including stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and any other necessary activities.

The whole Scrum Team (the Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master) is responsible for delivering a valuable and useful Increment at the end of each Sprint.

## Developers

Developers in the Scrum Team are dedicated to creating any part of a usable Increment during each Sprint.
The Developers are always accountable for:

- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog
- Ensuring quality by following the Definition of Done
- Adjusting their plan daily to achieve the Sprint Goal.
- Holding each other accountable as professionals.

## Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product generated by the Scrum Team's efforts.

The Product Owner is also responsible for effective Product Backlog management, which involves:

- Developing and clearly communicating the **Product Goal**.
- Creating and clearly communicating **Product Backlog** items.
- Ordering Product **Backlog items**.
- Ensuring the Product Backlog is **transparent, visible, and understood**.

The Product Owner's decisions should be evident in the content and prioritization of the Product Backlog, as well as in the inspectable Increment presented at the Sprint Review.

The Product Owner is **one person**, not a committee and is responsible for the Product Backlog.

## The Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for establishing Scrum as outlined in the Scrum Guide by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization. Additionally, the Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum Team improves its practices within the Scrum framework.

*The Scrum Master* supports the **Scrum Team** in various ways, including:

- **Coaching** team members in self-management and cross-functionality.
- **Helping** the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done.
- **Removing impediments** to the Scrum Team’s progress.
- Ensuring all **Scrum events are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox**.

*The Scrum Master* supports the **Product Owner** in various ways, including:

- **Assisting** in defining effective Product Goals and managing the Product Backlog.
- **Helping** the Scrum Team recognize the importance of clear and concise Product Backlog items.
- **Establishing** empirical product planning for complex environments.
- **Facilitating** stakeholder collaboration as needed or requested.

The Scrum Master supports the **organization** by:

- **Leading**, training, and coaching in Scrum adoption.
- **Planning and advising** on Scrum implementations.
- **Helping** employees and stakeholders adopt an empirical approach for complex work.
- **Removing barriers** between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

## Scrum Events

The Sprint includes all other Scrum events, providing formal opportunities to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are designed to ensure the necessary transparency. When events do not proceed as planned, opportunities for inspection and adjustment are missed. Scrum events create regularity and minimize the need for additional meetings. Ideally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.

## The Sprint

Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where **ideas are turned into value**.

All the work necessary to achieve **the Product Goal**, including **Sprint Planning**, **Daily Scrums**, **Sprint Review**, and **Sprint Retrospective**, happen within Sprints.

During the Sprint:

- **No changes are made that risks the Sprint Goal**.
- **Quality** stays consistent.
- The Product Backlog is **refined as necessary**.
- ***Scope* can be clarified and renegotiated** with the Product Owner as new information emerges.

Sprints ensure predictability by allowing for regular **inspection and adaptation** towards the Product Goal, at least once a month.
If a Sprint is **too long**, the Sprint Goal may become **invalid, complexity may increase, and risks may rise**.
Shorter Sprints can generate more learning cycles and limit the risk of cost and effort to a smaller timeframe, treating each Sprint as a short project.

Various practices like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows can forecast progress, but they do not replace the importance of empiricism.
**In complex environments, only past events can inform future decisions.**

A Sprint can be **canceled** if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, and only the **Product Owner has the authority to cancel it**.

## Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning kicks off the Sprint by outlining the work to be done, created collaboratively by the entire Scrum Team.
The Product Owner ensures attendees are ready to discuss the key Product Backlog items and their alignment with the Product Goal.
The Scrum Team may also invite others to provide advice during Sprint Planning.

**Topic 1: Why is this Sprint valuable?**

The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its **value and usability** in the current Sprint.
The entire Scrum Team collaborates **to define a Sprint Goal** that explains the **Sprint's value** to stakeholders.
This Sprint Goal must be **finalized** before Sprint Planning concludes.

**Topic 2: What can be Done this Sprint?**

Through discussions with the Product Owner, developers select and refine items from the Product Backlog for the current Sprint to enhance understanding and confidence. Although estimating Sprint capacity can be challenging, familiarity with past performance, future capacity, and the Definition of Done improves forecast accuracy.

**Topic 3: How will the chosen work get done?**

Developers plan the work for each selected Product Backlog item to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done, often breaking items into smaller tasks ( one day or less). The Sprint Goal, selected Product Backlog items, and the delivery plan form the Sprint Backlog. Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint, with shorter Sprints having shorter planning sessions.

## Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for Developers to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adjust the Sprint Backlog as needed.
If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.
Held at the same time and place each day, it;

- improves communication
- identifies impediments
- promotes quick decision-making
- reducing the need for other meetings
- creates focus and improves self-management

## Sprint Review

The Sprint Review inspects the Sprint's **outcome and plans future adaptations**. The Scrum Team **presents their work to stakeholders**, discussing progress toward the Product Goal. This collaborative session reviews accomplishments and changes, adjusting the Product Backlog as needed. Timeboxed to four hours for a one-month Sprint.

## Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective aims to enhance quality and effectiveness by reviewing the last Sprint's performance, identifying successes and problems, and planning improvements. Timeboxed to three hours for a one-month Sprint, it concludes the Sprint and may add improvements to the next Sprint Backlog.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information.
Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:

- For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
- For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
- For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.

These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.

## Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is a **prioritized** list of improvements for the product, serving as the **single** work source for the **Scrum Team**.
Product Backlog Items ready for a Sprint are refined and detailed by the Developers, **with the Product Owner assisting in understanding and selecting trade-offs.**

## Commitment: Product Goal

The Product Goal outlines a **future state of the product**, guiding the Scrum Team's planning.
The Product Goal is in the **Product Backlog**, which evolves to detail what will achieve the Product Goal.
The Product Goal is the **long-term objective** for the Scrum Team.
The Scrum Team must complete one Product Goal before moving to the next.
A product delivers value, has clear boundaries, stakeholders, and defined users.
A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.

## Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog includes the Sprint Goal, selected Product Backlog items, and a plan for delivering the Increment. It is a real-time, detailed plan by the Developers, updated throughout the Sprint to track progress and achieve the Sprint Goal.

## Commitment: Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is the **main objective** for the Sprint, providing flexibility in the work needed to achieve it and fostering team coherence and focus. Created during Sprint Planning and added to the Sprint Backlog, it guides the Developers, who collaborate with the Product Owner to adjust the scope if needed without changing the Sprint Goal.

## Increment

An Increment is a **verified, usable step** toward the Product Goal, additive to prior Increments. Multiple Increments can be created within a Sprint and presented at the Sprint Review (demo), but they can also be delivered to stakeholders earlier if they meet the **Definition of Done**.

## Commitment: Definition of Done

The Definition of Done is a formal description of the Increment's quality standards, ensuring transparency and shared understanding.
If a Product Backlog item meets this Definition of Done, it becomes an Increment; otherwise, it returns to the backlog.
All Scrum Teams must adhere to the Definition of Done, whether it's an organizational standard or created by the team.

## End Note

Scrum is freely available in this Guide, is immutable and must be implemented in its entirety to be considered Scrum.
It serves as a framework that can incorporate other techniques, methodologies, and practices.

## People

Jeff Sutherland, Jeff McKenna, John Scumniotales, Ken Schwaber, Mike Smith, and Chris Martin were key contributors to the early development of Scrum. Many others have since refined Scrum, making it what it is today.

## Scrum Guide History

Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland first presented Scrum at the **1995 OOPSLA Conference**, formalizing their previous learnings.
The Scrum Guide, developed by them over 30 years, documents Scrum, while other sources offer complementary insights to enhance its effectiveness.
